In this report, we hope to continue the great job started by David
Robinson, back in 2016, on analyzing Trump’s tweets. We aim to highlight
the sentiments invoked by Trump’s tweets since his campaign for his 2016
presidency
campaign.

## Trump’s Campaign Tweets

#### *On August 6, 2016 Todd Vaziri tweeted about Trump that "Every non-hyperbolic tweet is from iPhone (his staff). Every hyperbolic tweet is from Android (from him).*

Following in Robinson’s footsteps, we analyze the timestamps of Trump’s
tweets to see if tweets issued from each platform follow different
patterns -supporting the “different tweeters” hypothesis.

As can be seen in the figure above, the timings of tweets issued from
each platform do, in fact, follow different trends -with tweets issued
from “Android” peaking somewhere between 7 and 8 am: The proverbial
Presidential Morning
Tweet.

#### *But many questions yet remain: Do tweets issued by Trump’s campaign staff convey different emotions? Are tweets issued by Donald Trump more likely to be hyperbolic?*

A quick analysis of the most frequently used words across each platform,
produces the following
graph:

Furthermore, by applying sentiment analysis, we can see the most invoked
sentiments, by tweets on each platform, by word count in the following
graph:

## Trump’s Post-Campaign Tweets

We continue our analysis of Donald Trump’s tweets issued as President of
the United States, following his success at the 2016 Presidential
elections.

We continue to analyze Trump’s tweets (he now tweets through *both*
platforms: Android and iPhone).

The following graph shows the most frequent words tweeted by President
Donald Trump.
